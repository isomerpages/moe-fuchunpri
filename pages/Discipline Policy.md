<p>1. The goals of discipline are to develop self-disciplined and reflective
students.</p>
<p>2. The school believes that enforcing good discipline is part of its responsibility
to inculcate good character and values in students. The success depends
greatly on the understanding and co-operation from parents/guardians of
the students.</p>
<p>3. The school takes an educative stand towards discipline. Investigations
will be carried out by teachers, Year Heads and/or the Student Management
HOD to gather facts to ensure fairness to all parties involved.</p>
<p>4. Any student who commits an offence will be counselled and guided to
reflect on their misbehaviour and practice alternative acceptable behaviour(s).</p>
