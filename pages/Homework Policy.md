<p>Homework is assigned to help students learn. It is to be handed in on
time. Copying another student’s homework, or allowing your homework to
be copied, is cheating. Depending on the level, students can expect the
following estimated weekly homework load.</p>

<p>If you are spending more time than that, evaluate your use of time and
ask your teacher for help. When students are absent, they may contact a
friend to check on homework assignments. Alternatively, parents may enquire
about homework assignments through the teacher.</p>
<p>1. Homework is given about 3 times a week.</p>
<p>2. Homework could include the learning of spelling and reading.</p>
<p>3. Teachers will write the homework given on the class whiteboard.</p>
<p>4. Students should copy the homework for the day into the Student’s Handbook.</p>
<p>5. We seek parents’ assistance to check the Student’s Handbook for work
set.</p>
<p>6. Students should complete their homework conscientiously and hand it
in as required.</p>
