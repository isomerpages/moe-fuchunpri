<p><strong>1. VISITORS TO SCHOOL</strong>
</p>
<p>a) For the safety of our students, no parent/guardian/visitor is allowed
into the school premises without valid reasons.</p>
<p>b) Parents/Guardians are to leave and fetch their child/ward at and from
the respective school gates</p>
<p>before the start of school and after dismissal. Parents/Guardians who
are driving and dropping</p>
<p>their child/ward off at the school foyer can only do so from 6.45 a.m.
to 7.30 a.m.</p>
<p>c) Parents/Guardians are strongly encouraged to abide by the school’s
start and dismissal timings to ensure that their child/ward is punctual
for school and is safely fetched after school.</p>
<p>d) Parents/Guardians are only allowed to come into the school to fetch
their child/ward on rainy days.</p>
<p>e) All visitors MUST report to the security guard post at Gate A to collect
a Visitor’s Pass from the security post and report to the General Office.
They include parents/guardians who wish to take their child/ward out of
the school premises because of illness, injury or for any other urgent
matters. They must be able to produce proof of identify when requested
by school staff/security guard.</p>
<p>f) For parents/guardians who would like to meet up with their child’s/ward’s
teachers, prior arrangements must be made. This is to ensure an uninterrupted
and fruitful discussion. Parents/Guardians are also contact the teachers
via phone or email. Parents may also email any feedback to the school.</p>
<p><strong>2. STUDENT UNWELL AND INJURY INCIDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>a) Students who are unwell or sustain a physical injury during school
hours must report to their teacher or staff in the General Office immediately.</p>
<p>b) In minor cases, the teacher or staff will assess the student and administer
the appropriate first aid.</p>
<p>c) For serious incidents, e.g., cuts that require stitches, parents/guardians
will be contacted by the school to bring the student to the doctor for
treatment. If parents/guardians are not available at the time of the call,
the school will bring the child to the nearest clinic or hospital.</p>
<p>d) In very serious cases, e.g., loss of consciousness or profuse bleeding,
an ambulance will be called immediately, and a staff will accompany the
student to the hospital in the ambulance. Parents will be informed of the
hospital the child has been sent to.</p>
<p>e) Hence, it is critical that parents/guardians provide updated information
of their contact numbers, home addresses and the medical records of their
child/ward.</p>
<p><strong>3. BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AND/OR DISTRIBUTIONS OF GOODIE BAGS</strong>
</p>
<p>a) In consideration of students’ dietary concerns and unhealthy peer comparisons,
no birthday celebration and/or distribution of gifts to other students
is allowed in the school.</p>
<p><strong>4. GUIDELINES ON PHOTOGRAPHY/VIDEOGRAPHY IN SCHOOL</strong>
</p>
<p>a) For safety and security purposes, some areas within the school premises
are monitored via CCTVs.</p>
<p>b) Under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), photograph(s) and video
image(s) of an individual are considered personal data. This is to notify
parents/guardians that photograph(s) or video image(s) of students and
parents/ guardians may be captured during school activities and events
such as classroom lessons, CCA, school camps and celebration events. The
school may use and publish such photographs and/ or video recordings in
school publications, website, social media channels, and other communication
channels. However, these photographs and/ or video images will not be released
to any third party without the individual’s consent.</p>
