<p><strong>“DOs”</strong>
</p>
<p>• Always cross the roads at designated pedestrian crossings, overhead
bridges, underpasses or zebra crossings.</p>
<p>• Always look out for inattentive drivers at designated traffic crossings
even though you have the right of way.</p>
<p>• Always walk on footpaths when they are available. Otherwise, walk in
a single file close to the edge of the road, facing on-coming traffic.</p>
<p>• Always hold on to handrails on the bus. Sudden braking or swerving of
the bus could throw you off balance.</p>
<p>• Always wait for the bus to come to a complete stop before boarding or
alighting.</p>
<p>• Always keep a lookout for any on-coming traffic before stepping out
of a bus.</p>
<p>• Always use Gate B if you are using the bus-stops along Woodlands Ave
1 outside the school.</p>
<p><strong>“DON’Ts”</strong>
</p>
<p>• Never dash across the road without looking out for on-coming traffic.</p>
<p>• Never cross in front of a stationary vehicle or in between two stationary
vehicles.</p>
<p>• Never cross when the “red man” appears or when the “green man” is flashing.</p>
<p><strong>PEDESTRIAN CROSSING</strong>
</p>
<p>• Obey the instructions of teachers on duty at stipulated periods at the
pedestrian crossing outside the school gate.</p>
<p>• Students should check and see that motor vehicles stop at the pedestrian
crossing before they walk across.</p>
<p>• While walking across, students should raise their right hands to alert
the drivers/riders of motor vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>SCHOOL CAR PARK</strong>
</p>
<p>The school car park has limited parking lots. Visitors to school are kindly
requested to park at the public car parks in the vicinity of the school.</p>
<p>In view of the morning peak hours (7.00 am to 7.30 am), parents are allowed
to drive into the school compound for the purpose of dropping off their
children. The speed limit within the school is 15 km/h.</p>
<p>The security guards are stationed at the main gate and at the drop-off
point (outside General Office) to ensure smooth flow of traffic and safety
of the students.</p>
