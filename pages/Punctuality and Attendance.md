<p>a) Students must observe punctuality at all times. Students are to be
in school by 7.30 a.m. during school days (unless otherwise stated). Arrival
of students after that would be considered as late coming.</p>
<p>b) School attendance is compulsory. Absence from school without any valid
reason is a major school offence. Reasons for absence that are not valid
include oversleeping and wilful absence from school.</p>
<p>c) Hence to account for attendance, students who are absent must produce
a Medical Certificate or a letter of explanation from parents on the day
they return to school.</p>
<p>d) Parents/Guardians who wish to take their child/ward overseas for holidays
and/or to attend to personal matters are to do so during the school vacations
or after school hours.</p>
<p>e) On the day of a weighted assessment/year-end examinations, only Medical
Certificates will be accepted to cover the student’s absence.</p>
<p>f) Students are not allowed to leave the school premises during curriculum
time or before supplementary/remedial lessons/CCA without permission. Any
such act would be considered as truancy.</p>
<p>g) For safety reasons, students are not allowed to leave the school during
lunch time when they have to stay back for after-school activities unless
parents’ letters of request are given to the form teachers. Students are
strongly encouraged to eat in the school canteen.</p>
<p>h) Parents/Guardians will be contacted by the school if their child is
ill and has to be taken home or to the doctor. Parents/Guardians must be
present to accompany and sign out their child for him/her to leave the
school. Prior approval must be obtained at the General Office for leaving
school before dismissal time.</p>
