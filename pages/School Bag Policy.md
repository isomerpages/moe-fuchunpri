<p>1. The Form Teachers will issue a copy of the timetable to each student.</p>
<p>2. Students will have subject files which contain only current term’s
worksheets. All other worksheets should be kept at home. (Not applicable
to English composition files)</p>
<p>3. Students should bring only 1 storybook per day for their daily silent
reading. The storybook should not be a hardcover book to lighten the weight
of their school bag.</p>
<p>4. Students are advised to carry a water bottle not bigger than 800ml.
It can be refilled at the water coolers available in school.</p>
<p>5. Students are advised not to bring trolley bags to school which can
be cumbersome when going up and down the stairs. The school bags should
be as lightweight as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s P.A.C.K. it right!</p>

<p>Carry your bag properly by using both of the straps instead of just one.
This distributes the weight evenly across your shoulders and will not cause
unnecessary stress on your back.</p>
