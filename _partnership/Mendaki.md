<p dir="ltr">This year, the school is partnering with <strong>Mendaki Tuition Scheme (MTS) </strong>to provide additional support to our P6 students in Mathematics. Besides being a centre for MTS on Saturdays where students can sign up for English, Mathematics and Science lessons for all levels, additional lessons are also conducted on Tuesday afternoons in school specially arranged for interested P6 students.<br /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The MTS is aimed at providing academic support intervention to students to enable them to attain quality passes in their school or national examinations. The school and MTS work together to customise the lessons such that the tutors will work on our students&rsquo; targeted areas for improvement by focusing on specific topics/skills which have been pre-identified by the school.</p>
