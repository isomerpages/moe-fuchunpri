<h4><strong>PACES Chairperson's Message</strong></h4>
<p>A very warm welcome to P.A.C.E.S, an acronym we coined for Parents Assisting Children&rsquo;s Education in School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.A.C.E.S committee members meet up with the Principal and its school representatives on a termly basis to provide bottom-up feedback, propose suggestions, and also share its concerns and deployment plans. Through the same platform, the committee is kept abreast of impending school programmes and plans. Annually, get-together sessions for the committee such as learning journeys are organised where, along with the Principal and its school representatives, the team visits places of interest and engages in informal interactions to heighten bonding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents play a vital role in their children's development and education. Hence, as the school continuously communicates with parents and reviews its programmes to improve teaching and learning, we as parents too can extend our support by engaging the school through our suggestions and involving ourselves in the school&rsquo;s programmes by partaking in both its activities and special events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our parent volunteers have been supporting the school in its numerous activities and programmes such as Learning Journeys and Kidsread which is a programme initiated by the National Library Board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our parents also assist in the school&rsquo;s unique Home Skills Programme which is tailored to Fuchunians at different levels. The lessons integrate the learning of English, Mathematics and Science as well as display of values. During the Home Skills lessons, pupils engage in activities such as sandwich-making, basic cooking, baking and also simple sewing techniques.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunities for parents to be involved in the above mentioned programmes provide a win-win partnership for both parents and the school. Whilst the school gets to enhance the safety of its pupils, parents can better understand their children&rsquo;s development as they exhibit keen interest in their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come join us! We look forward to more parents joining our P.A.C.E.S family. Let us work hand-in-hand in strengthening this parents-school partnership as we strive towards a common goal to nurture our young Fuchunians to be A Concerned Leader, A Lifelong Learner!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Yours sincerely,<br />Mdm Mazni Senain<br />P.A.C.E.S Chairperson</p>
