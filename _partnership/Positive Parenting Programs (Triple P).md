<p dir="ltr"><strong>Care Corner </strong>is the partnering member of Fuchun Primary School who supports our parents through their signature program - <strong>Positive Parenting Programs (Triple P)</strong>. To better understand your parenting needs and preferences, parents are invited to participate in the Parenting Need Survey in the beginning of the year. Base on the different needs of the parents, the Care Corner will run seminars, talks and small group discussion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Care corner helps parents to learn simple &amp; practical strategies so that they can confidently manage their children's behaviour, prevent problems developing, and build strong and healthy relationships with them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In May, there are talks on developing Confident, Competent Children (19 May 2023) &amp; Resilient Children (26 May 2023).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In July, the Mandarin and Malay Speaking seminars are free for parents that are interested. Parents of all primary school-going children island wide are strongly encouraged to register.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Positive Parenting Programme is an endorsed programme by MSF.</p>
