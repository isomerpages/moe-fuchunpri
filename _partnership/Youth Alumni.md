<h4><strong>Fuchun Youth Alumni (FYA)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Belief: Once a Fuchunian, Always a Fuchunian<br /></strong>The Fuchun Youth Alumni (FYA) was established in 2012 with the objective of creating opportunities and platforms for the graduated Fuchunians to foster closer ties with the Fuchun Family. The school recognises the importance of a strong alumni network to fulfil its mission of nurturing a community of passionate learners, who are leaders with sound character, in partnership with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The FYA is managed by a team of ex-Fuchunians who are committed to engaging the Fuchunians to support the school in achieving its education outcomes. FYA aims to bring a positive influence and hopes to foster a sense of belonging and school pride in the Fuchunians through their commitment and contributions to their alma mater.</p>
<p>Since the establishment in 2012, FYA has organised leadership training annually for the newly appointed student leaders of the school. FYA has also been actively participating in the school&rsquo;s events such as the Fuchun Arts Nite, P6 Graduation Nite and the Speech and Prize Giving Ceremony.</p>
