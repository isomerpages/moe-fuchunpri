<p>FTGP provides dedicated time for teachers to build strong bonds with their
students through structured Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) lessons
and interaction activities. It also incorporates key topics such as Cyber
Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), and Protection from
Abuse (for Primary 1 to 4), helping students apply core values and social-emotional
competencies in meaningful, real-life contexts.</p>
<p>Beyond explicit teaching, FTGP strengthens Teacher-Student Relationships
(TSR) and Student-Student Relationships (SSR). With dedicated one-to-one
interaction time, form teachers are better able to understand and support
each pupil, creating a safe and supportive environment that enhances overall
well-being and learning.</p>
