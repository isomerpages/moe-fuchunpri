<h4><strong>Our Song</strong></h4>
<p>We are children of Fuchun school
<br>Ever proud to be in this school
<br>Day by day we learn and play
<br>Striving forward on our way
<br>
<br><strong>Chorus</strong>:
<br>Now we sing this song each day
<br>To tell the world what part we'll play
<br>Fuchun school is here to stay
<br>We will march forth, come what may
<br>
<br>Like a beacon tall and bright
<br>Harbouring a guiding light
<br>Leading us to heights above
<br>loyal to the school we love
<br>
<br><strong>Music and Lyrics by:</strong>

<p>The school emblem is created through the fusion of F, C, P &amp; S which
stands for Fuchun Primary School.</p>
<p>The design projects togetherness and unity and the Bird-in-Flight motif-
symbolising the soaring spirit of both pupils and staff - is in keeping
with the school motto "EVER ONWARD".</p>
<p>The colours - gold and blue symbolise purity and success through perseverance.</p>
