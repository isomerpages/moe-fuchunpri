<p>At Fuchun Primary, we believe every student belongs. Our Integration of
International Students programme supports international pupils in adjusting
to life in Singapore and building strong connections with their peers.</p>
<p>Through school activities and meaningful interactions, we help our students
learn about local customs, form friendships, and feel a sense of belonging.
By creating an inclusive environment, we hope to make their learning journey
in Fuchun a joyful and enriching one.</p>
