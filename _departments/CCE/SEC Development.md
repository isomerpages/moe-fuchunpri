<h4>Social Emotional Development</h4>
<p>We aim to develop our students with a strong core and equipped with the
5 Social Emotional (SE) Competencies so that they can manage themselves,
build quality relationships with others and make responsible decisions.</p>

<p>The endeavour to develop Social Emotional competencies (Middle Ring) is
also part of our broader goal to develop future-ready Fuchunians well-equipped
with the necessary 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competencies (21CC) to
thrive in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Primary 4 My Mind, Body and Me</h4>
<p>During the Term 2 Parent-Teacher Meeting, our Primary 4 students received
an individualised report titled "My Mind, Body and Me". This report provides
personalised feedback and practical tips to guide meaningful discussions
between parents and children. It focuses on supporting studentsâ€™ Social-Emotional
Development (e.g. Positivity, Emotional Regulation, Self-Control) and addressing
key health concerns (e.g. Cyber-Wellness habits, Sleep hygiene).</p>
<p>We hope this initiative will strengthen home-school partnerships and encourage
deeper conversations with your child during the June holidays.</p>
