<h4>Social Emotional Development @ Fuchun Primary School</h4>
<p>We aim to develop our students with a strong core and equipped with the
5 Social Emotional (SE) Competencies so that they can manage themselves,
build quality relationships with others and make responsible decisions.</p>

<p>The endeavour to develop Social Emotional competencies (Middle Ring) is
also part of our broader goal to develop future-ready Fuchunians well-equipped
with the necessary 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (21CC) to thrive
in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Primary 4 My Mind, Body and Me</h4>
<p>Our Primary 4 students are given an individualised report&nbsp; (My Mind,
Body and Me) in Term 2 to provide parents with personalised feedback and
tips to improve on your child’s Social Emotional Development and general
health habits. We hope that this will promote stronger parental engagement
and spur more in-depth conversations with your child during the June holidays.</p>
