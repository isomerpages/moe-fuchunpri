<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>To nurture students into informed, concerned and participative citizens
through inquiry and authentic learning experiences</p>
<h4>Our Lessons and Programmes</h4>
<p>As the SS syllabus is progressive in nature, there are several programmes
and activities that are designed for the respective levels to achieve the
intended learning goals.</p>

<p><strong>Field-Based Learning through Cohort Learning Journeys&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Field-based Learning (FbL) refers to learning that extends beyond the
walls of the classroom where students are exposed to authentic real-world
settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students, starting from Primary 3 to Primary 6 levels go on various&nbsp;<strong><em>Learning Journeys</em></strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;contextualise
their learning experiences, enabling the relational learning of concepts
and content.&nbsp;Such authentic learning experiences shape the students’
development through experiences that they have, which include using their
five senses to soak in the rich cultural aspects these places have to offer.
Besides that, students also learn to understand and respect cultural differences
as well as to embrace diversity.</p>

<p><strong>Commemorating National Education and Festive Events</strong>
</p>
<p>At Fuchun Primary, National Education is brought to life through the meaningful
celebration of key NE events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship
Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day. These commemorative moments
serve as powerful platforms for students to reflect on Singapore’s journey,
deepen their sense of belonging, and understand the values and collective
efforts that have shaped our nation.</p>
