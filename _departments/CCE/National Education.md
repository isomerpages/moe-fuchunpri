<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>To nurture students into informed, concerned and participative citizens
through inquiry and authentic learning experiences</p>
<h4>Our Approach</h4>
<p>Aligned to the Singapore Social Studies (SS) curriculum, we hope to prepare
our students to be citizens of tomorrow through a better understanding
of the relationship between Singapore and the world they live in. Through
our lessons, we seek to arouse the students’ curiosity to think deeper
into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic
learning experiences that the students undergo during their SS lessons,
they gain relevant knowledge and are able to have a better understanding
of these issues in order to hone their critical and reflective thinking
skills. We also hope to inculcate in our students a deeper understanding
of the values that define the Singaporean society through the learning
experiences provided during SS lessons. As such, we envision all Fuchunians
to be informed, concerned and participative citizens who are capable of
quality decision-making processes and have an impassioned spirit to contribute
responsibly to the world we all live in.</p>
<h4>Our Programmes</h4>
<p>As the SS syllabus is progressive in nature, there are several programmes
and activities that are designed for the respective levels to achieve the
intended learning goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Strengthen &amp; Support</strong>
</p>
<p>Field-based Learning (FbL) refers to learning that extends beyond the
walls of the classroom where students are exposed to authentic real-world
settings. Students can conduct hands-on exploration in a focussed area
of study, thus engaging them in multi-sensory learning experiences. As
part of engaging students in inquiry-based learning, FbL will also motivate
and sustain their interest in the subject matter as students learn to explore
the surroundings, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic
being studied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students, starting from Primary 4 to Primary 6 levels go on <strong><em>Learning Journeys</em></strong> to
Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery, Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, Indian Heritage
Center and Asian Civilisation Museum to contextualise their learning experiences,
enabling the relational learning of concepts and content. Such authentic
learning experiences shape the students’ development through experiences
that they have, which include using their five senses to soak in the rich
cultural aspects these places have to offer. Besides that, students also
learn to understand and respect the cultural differences as well as to
embrace diversity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Stretch</strong>
</p>
<p>Students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 levels are tasked to undertake various <strong><em>performance tasks</em></strong> aligned
to the learning objectives outlined in the syllabus. This learning experience
enables students to work collaboratively and engage in active discussions
on real-life issues.</p>
