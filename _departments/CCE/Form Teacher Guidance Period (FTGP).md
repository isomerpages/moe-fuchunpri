<p>FTGP provides dedicated time for teachers to build strong bonds with their
students through structured Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) lessons
and interaction activities. It also incorporates key topics such as Cyber
Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), and Mental Wellness,
helping students apply core values and social-emotional competencies in
meaningful, real-life contexts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Beyond teaching, FTGP strengthens Teacher-Student Relationships
(TSR) through dedicated one-to-one interaction time, where form teachers
are better able to understand and support each pupil, creating a safe and
supportive environment for learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our FTGP Periods are embedded within our signature <strong>Homeroom Programme</strong> which
aims to nurture the holistic development of every student. Do check out
