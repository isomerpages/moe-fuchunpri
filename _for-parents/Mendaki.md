<p><strong>Partnering with Yayasan Mendaki for Tuition Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Yayasan MENDAKI is the pioneer self-help group in providing tuition for
the public. MTS aims to provide quality and affordable tuition to help
students achieve better results in their school and national exams. MTS
is aligned with MOE's curriculum and provides additional developmental
activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fuchun Primary School has been a centre for Mendaki Tuition Scheme on
Saturdays for many years to provide tuition programme to students in the
neighbourhood. However, since 4 years ago, Fuchun Primary have also been
partnering Mendaki to provide additional support on <strong>Wednesday afternoons</strong>.
This year, we will open classes <strong>for Primary 5 and 6</strong> students:</p>
<p>2.00pm – 3.30pm: Mathematics</p>
<p>3.30pm – 5.00pm: Science&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school and MTS work together to customise the lessons such that the
tutors will work on our students’ targeted areas for improvement by focusing
on specific topics/skills which have been pre-identified by the school.</p>
