<h4>Apply for GIRO Standing Order</h4>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to apply for your child's school and miscellaneous
fees to be paid through GIRO.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the GIRO scheme with MOE through&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees/egiro" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eGIRO</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>The same GIRO arrangement will also be extended to cover their payment
of enrichment programmes, school charges and deduction of national examination
fees (Primary School Leaving Examination and GCE Examinations), where applicable.</p>
<p>This GIRO instruction will carry on if your child/ward remains in a Government
or Government Aided primary school, secondary school or junior college.</p>
<p>The schedule for the various types of deductions are as follows :</p>

</td>

<p>If there are any charges overpaid by your child/ward, the credit balance
will be used to offset future fees payable in the same academic year. Any
excess credit balance (after offsetting future fees) will then be refunded
to this GIRO account by the end of the following month.</p>
