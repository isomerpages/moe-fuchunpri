<h4><strong>Fuchun Youth Alumni (FYA)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Belief: Once a Fuchunian, Always a Fuchunian<br></strong>The
Fuchun Youth Alumni (FYA) was established in 2012 with the objective of
creating opportunities and platforms for the graduated Fuchunians to foster
closer ties with the Fuchun Family. The school recognises the importance
of a strong alumni network to fulfil its mission of nurturing a community
of passionate learners, who are leaders with sound character, in partnership
with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The FYA is managed by a team of ex-Fuchunians who are committed to engaging
the Fuchunians to support the school in achieving its education outcomes.
FYA aims to bring a positive influence and hopes to foster a sense of belonging
and school pride in the Fuchunians through their commitment and contributions
to their alma mater.</p>
<p>Since the establishment in 2012, FYA has organised leadership training
annually for the newly appointed student leaders of the school. FYA has
also been actively participating in the school’s events such as the Fuchun
Arts Nite, P6 Graduation Nite and the Speech and Prize Giving Ceremony.</p>
