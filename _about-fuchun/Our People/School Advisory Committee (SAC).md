<p>The school works collaboratively with the SAC to&nbsp;improve student
learning and school effectiveness by bridging to the community, so as to
achieve the Desired Outcomes of Education; and to participate in nation
building.&nbsp;The school leverages the expertise, diverse perspectives,
experiences and networks of SAC members to&nbsp;provide advice on the strategic
directions for the school within MOE’s policy framework.&nbsp;The SAC members&nbsp;garner
support for the school from stakeholders and the community through the
members’ networks, to achieve positive student learning outcomes, in line
with the national educational goals and objectives. They also&nbsp;provide
resources, connections, networks and partnerships to enrich the schools’
programmes so that the school can contribute to the community and the community
can contribute to the school, for the holistic development of the students.</p>
