and 37 classrooms.</p>

<p>Our signature Home Skills Programme, that was initially launched in 2007
for latch key students, expanded to all students to teach them valuable
life skills such as cooking and sewing, to help them be independent and
self-reliant. We were invited to share the Homeskills Programme at the
2009 Redesigning Pedagogy International Conference.</p>
