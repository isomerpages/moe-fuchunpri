<h4><strong>General Information for Parents</strong></h4>
<div>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<div>Monitoring your Child's Health</div>
<div>Check if your child/ward is well before he/she leaves for school every day. If they show symptoms of being unwell, please take him/her to the doctor and allow him/her to rest at home for the full duration indicated on the Medical Certificate (MC). Ensure that your child/ward recovers fully before returning to school.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Absence from School<br />
<div>If a student is absent from school, he/she must provide a medical certificate or letter signed by parents explaining the reason for his/her absence from school.</div>
<div>Parents are strongly discouraged to take their children out of school for non-essential travels or family functions during the school term. This is to allow students to inculcate the habit of commitment and diligence and understand the importance of being present in school during term time.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Student&rsquo;s Absence on Assessment/Examination Days
<div>If a student has a fever or looks visibly unwell, he/she will not be allowed to sit for examinations / assessments. Parents will be contacted to take him/her home. Students should practice social responsibility and stay away from crowds when they are unwell to prevent the spread of diseases or illnesses.</div>
<div>If a student is absent for any examination / assessment, he/she must produce a valid medical certificate or other valid documents upon return to school. TCM medical certificates and parents&rsquo; letters are not valid for such examinations and assessments. Students will be given a zero mark if no medical certificates or valid documents are provided for his/her absence. The school will not conduct a make-up for Written examinations/assessments.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Early Departure
<div>Students are not allowed to leave the school during school hours unless parents/guardians come personally and obtain permission. If parents are picking up their child/ward who is unwell or needs to leave school before dismissal time they are required to fill in and submit the Early Departure Form at the General Office. This will ensure safety of the child and that he/she leaves with his/her parent or an authorised adult.</div>
<div>For any planned early dismissal, advance notice must be given either by phone or written note to the respective Form or Co-Form Teachers.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Visits to the School
<div>All parents or guardians are to obtain a Visitors&rsquo; Pass from the security guards at the main gate before they proceed to the General Office for assistance. Parents / Guardians are not allowed in any other locations within the school premises without permission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;If parents would like to speak with the Form/Co-Form/Subject teachers, prior appointment must be made at least 1 day ahead. This is to ensure an uninterrupted and fruitful discussion. Parents can also contact the teachers via phone or email.</div>
<div>Students are encouraged to act responsibly by taking ownership in packing their bags every day and bringing the required books/materials to school. Parents/domestic helpers are discouraged from delivering any omitted items to our students during school hours.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>School Canteen
<div>Parents and other visitors are not allowed to patronise the school canteen stalls. This is to ensure that the food prepared by the canteen vendors is sufficient for staff and students.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Road Safety
<div>Parents who are driving into the school compound to drop their child/ward must abide by the school safety rules. Do co-operate with the traffic marshals to ensure an overall safe and smooth traffic flow. Please drop your child/ward only at the designated drop-off points.</div>
<div>Do not sound the horn within the school compound.</div>
<div>Teach your child how to alight from the car as quickly as possible so as not to hold up the flow of traffic into the school.</div>
<div>If you and your child are cycling to school, please dismount at the school gate to avoid hitting pedestrians who are walking through the gates. Students who need to park their bicycles in school must seek permission from HOD Student Management.</div>
<div>For the safety of our staff and students, the school reserves the right to stop any errant drivers from entering the school premises.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Facilitating Birthday Celebrations and/or Distribution of gifts to students
<div>The school is unable to accede to requests from parents to assist in facilitating parties or distributing gifts to celebrate your children&rsquo;s birthdays. While the school understands that the occasion is special to children, the school would like to seek parents&rsquo; understanding in not bringing food or gifts for their children&rsquo;s classmates. This is for us to be careful about the students&rsquo; dietary needs and food tolerance as well as to care for the emotional well-being of students who are unable to have the opportunity of distributing gifts to their school/class mates. The school seeks the parents&rsquo; understanding and cooperation on this matter.</div>
