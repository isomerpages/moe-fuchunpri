This will ensure safety of the child and that he/she leaves with his/her parent or an authorised adult.</div>
<div>For any planned early dismissal, advance notice must be given in writing to the respective Form Teachers.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">

<div>&nbsp;If parents would like to speak with the Form/Co-Form/Subject teachers, prior appointment must be made at least 1 day ahead. This is to ensure an uninterrupted and fruitful discussion. Parents can also contact the teachers via phone or email.</div>
<div>Students are encouraged to act responsibly by taking ownership in packing their bags every day and bringing the required books/materials to school. Parents/domestic helpers are discouraged from delivering any omitted items to our students during school hours.</div>

While the school understands that the occasion is special to children, the school would like to seek parents’ understanding in not bringing food or gifts for their children’s classmates. This is for us to be careful about the students’ dietary needs and food tolerance as well as to care for the emotional well-being of students who are unable to have the opportunity of distributing gifts to their school/class mates.
