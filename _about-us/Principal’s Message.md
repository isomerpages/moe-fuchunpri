			<b>Caring for Everyone</b>
<br><br>
As we enter 2023 with new dreams and hopes, let us endeavor to seize every opportunity to grow and learn as a school. The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of being adaptable and resilient during uncertain and difficult times. During our struggles, we were also thankful for the unceasing care, encouragement, and support from those around us. They really kept us going.

			Our vision, <i>“A Nurturing, Resilient and Forward-Looking School Community”</i> espouses the idea of growing stronger together. The success story of every Fuchunian is not merely an outcome, but it speaks of a journey of learning, growing, and excelling together as a school community. It is about having a growth mindset to see beyond current realities, with each of us doing our part to bring out the best in our students and staff.

			First and foremost, we are cognizant that students must first feel safe and cared for before any learning can take place. Hence, our emphasis has always been on creating caring and enabling school and class environments, characterised by a strong culture of care, positive teacher-student and peer relationships, as well as quality student well-being programmes, that will guide students in navigating the changes and complexities in their lives.

In everything that our students learn and do, they must be anchored on values such as integrity, respect and empathy for others. Every child is deemed a leader in our school. Personal leadership requires the students to first learn to lead themselves through inculcating positive habits and self-discipline.

			Inspiring our students to learn with joy and passion is a precursor to helping them discover their interests and strengths to extend into their future learning. Our school now offers Higher Mother Languages Programmes from P3 to P6 and E2K Math and Science to students who have the interests and aptitudes in these areas. Our Applied Learning Programme aims to develop our students to be Confident and Empathetic Communicators in both English and Mother Tongue languages. Their creative and critical thinking skills are also positively enhanced when they engage in our music programmes and performing arts CCAs through our Arts-focused Learn for Life Programme. These are among the many interesting and meaningful learning experiences that our students can look forward to enjoying this year.

Dear Parents/Guardians and Students,

**Caring for Everyone**

As we enter 2023 with new dreams and hopes, let us endeavor to seize every opportunity to grow and learn as a school. The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of being adaptable and resilient during uncertain and difficult times. During our struggles, we were also thankful for the unceasing care, encouragement, and support from those around us. They really kept us going.

Our vision, _“A Nurturing, Resilient and Forward-Looking School Community”_ espouses the idea of growing stronger together. The success story of every Fuchunian is not merely an outcome, but it speaks of a journey of learning, growing, and excelling together as a school community. It is about having a growth mindset to see beyond current realities, with each of us doing our part to bring out the best in our students and staff.

**Finding New Ways**

To navigate the challenges of the future with confidence, our students need to understand their own strengths and interests and learn the necessary skills and aptitudes that will enable them to collaborate, connect and co-create with others. Our mission, “_We provide a caring and enabling environment to develop every Fuchunian holistically as future-ready learners, through strong engagement in joyful learning and character building_” explains our pursuit to find new and varied ways to prepare our students to be future ready.

First and foremost, we are cognizant that students must first feel safe and cared for before any learning can take place. Hence, our emphasis has always been on creating caring and enabling school and class environments, characterised by a strong culture of care, positive teacher-student and peer relationships, as well as quality student well-being programmes, that will guide students in navigating the changes and complexities in their lives.

Next, we hope that every Fuchunian will develop and become a “Values-Driven Leader” and “Passionate Learner”. In everything that our students learn and do, they must be anchored on values such as integrity, respect and empathy for others. Every child is deemed a leader in our school.

**Stronger Together**
