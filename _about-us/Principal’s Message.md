<p>For four decades, we've been nurturing bright minds and building a community
that shines with warmth and brilliance. Our theme, "FCP40: A Treasure of
Gems Shining Together", perfectly captures the essence of our school. Remember,
"Every Gem Matters, Every Shine Counts" - this is more than just a tagline;
it's our promise to each of you.</p>
<p>This year, we're rolling out an exciting line-up of events and activities
that will showcase:</p>
