<p>Dear Fuchun Family,</p><p></p><p>As we embark on the journey of the new school year in 2024, I extend warm wishes to all for a year filled with positivity, growth opportunities, and self-discovery.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the accomplishments of 2023, I was heartened by how our students had embraced the ethos of becoming “Successful Fuchunians” in multiple domains. This educational philosophy redefines the notion of success as being consistent in displaying school values, a growth mindset, making good choices, and fostering positive relationships. They demonstrated remarkable progress, receiving recognition during the year-end “Celebrate Us” ceremony for embodying values, holistic development, and contribution to school.</p><p></p><p>Looking forward to 2024, we introduce five Superheroes as part of our Values Education Programme – Professor (Passion for Learning), Iron Heart (Integrity), Empath (Empathy), Ref (Respect) and Rock (Resilience). With their powers combined, these Superheroes aim to help our students internalize and demonstrate school values, character strengths and positive learning dispositions, empowering them to become superheroes of their lives and peers.</p><p></p><p>Responding to the evolving educational landscape, we proudly unveil innovative learning spaces designed to equip our students with critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration skills necessary for success in the 21st century. These include an outdoor vertical farm and hydroponics pavilion for enhancing learning on food sustainability; an interactive soundscape fostering free play with musical instruments; and collaborative art and music galleries. These spaces encourage multisensory exploration and providing versatile settings for lessons and interdisciplinary activities.</p><p>In today’s technology-driven world, conducive online learning environments are also crucial to prepare our students as future-ready learners. This year, we invite parents to partner with us in championing a safe digital space for students. Our Fuchun CyberWellness Toolkit for Parents, available on the school website, offers tips and advice on children’s digital device usage and navigating the online world. Our newly minted “Family Friday” homeroom lessons, which aim to promote family education, will leverage this toolkit in empowering parents to engage in Cyber Wellness discussions with their children at home.</p><p></p><p>To our students, embrace 2024 with confidence, relish in the joy of learning through exciting school programmes lined up for you, and remember that possibilities for your development are limitless!</p><p></p><p>Here's to a meaningful and successful 2024!</p><p></p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Mrs Eunice Lim</p><p>Principal</p>
