School Canteen
--------------

Our school canteen provides food and beverages in accordance to the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB’s) Healthy Meals in Schools Programme HMSP. Our canteen stallholders had supported the school in many ways to provide a healthier choice set meals and beverages at affordable prices.  They had participated in the HMSP Version 2.0 piloted by the HPB and went through one-to-one consultations and training sessions by HPB-appointed Chef in January 2022. With this programme, they successfully introduced revised canteen menus which incorporated a variety of healthier set meals to ensure students receive the appropriate nutrients necessary for their growing needs.
