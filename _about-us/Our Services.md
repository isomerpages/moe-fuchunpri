<h4><strong>School Canteen</strong></h4>
<p>Our school canteen provides food and beverages in accordance to the Health Promotion Board&rsquo;s (HPB&rsquo;s) Healthy Meals in Schools Programme HMSP. Our canteen stallholders had supported the school in many ways to provide a healthier choice set meals and beverages at affordable prices. They had participated in the HMSP Version 2.0 piloted by the HPB and went through one-to-one consultations and training sessions by HPB-appointed Chef in January 2022. With this programme, they successfully introduced revised canteen menus which incorporated a variety of healthier set meals to ensure students receive the appropriate nutrients necessary for their growing needs.</p>
